😃 Hi there! I'm Gabriele 👋
</h1>

I'm a budding Machine Learning Engineer and an aspiring Data Scientist, passionate about data and all related topics concerning it. I dedicate myself to learning about subjects related to Machine Learning, Data Mining, Deep Learning, Time Series, LLMs, and Generative AI.

Here on my GitHub, you'll have the opportunity to learn alongside me about these topics! I believe the best way to learn is by explaining in such detail that it inspires others to do the same. Therefore, I am always open to questions and collaborations.
